        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This spaghetti and meat sauce is one of my tried-and-true easy dinner recipes. It’s simple, family-friendly and ready in just 30 minutes. Doesn’t get better than that!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Onions and garlic</strong>: These aromatics add wonderful flavor! Sauté them in oil first before adding the meat.</li>
            <li><strong>Meat</strong>: I like to use ground beef, but Italian sausage works really well, too.</li>
            <li><strong>Tomato sauce</strong>: This easy spaghetti recipe calls for 1 jar of marinara or spaghetti sauce (I love Prego spaghetti sauce), but you can make your own homemade marinara sauce if you prefer.</li>
            <li><strong>Diced tomatoes</strong>: I like the texture diced tomatoes add to the sauce, making it a bit heartier, but this is totally optional.</li>
            <li><strong>Spaghetti</strong>: This long noodle is ideal for soaking up the sauce, but you can use any shape you like.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Brown the meat</strong>. Heat olive oil in a frying pan. Add onions and cook until translucent. Stir in garlic and cook 1 more minute. Next add in meat and seasonings and cook until beef has browned.</li>
            <li><strong>Simmer</strong>. Stir in marinara sauce and tomatoes and let simmer uncovered.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook noodles</strong>. While sauce is simmering, cook the spaghetti noodles according to package.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve and enjoy</strong>! Serve meat sauce over cooked pasta and top with fresh basil and parmesan cheese, if desired.</li>
        </ol>
