        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe is inspired by traditional Japanese ramen. I love it because it has rich, savory broth and of course â€“ all of the delicious toppings! For my take on this recipe, I added sauteed mushrooms, bokchoy, sliced green onions, grilled chicken, and of course soft boiled eggs! The best part about making homemade ramen is that you can customize the broth and toppings exactly how you want!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Sesame Oil</strong>: Used for cooking the vegetables in. I love using sesame oil to cook with because it adds the best nutty flavor.</li>
            <li><strong>Minced Garlic</strong>: Makes the broth nice and savory!</li>
            <li><strong>Ginger Paste</strong>: A classic ingredient in Asian cuisine. This adds zip to the flavor of the broth.</li>
            <li><strong>Sliced Mushrooms</strong>: Regular brown mushrooms work great here! You can also use shiitake mushrooms.</li>
            <li><strong>Chicken Stock</strong>: Chicken broth is typically what I have on hand and great for a savory soup base. If you want your ramen to have more of the classic Tonkotsu flavor, use pork broth instead. You can also use vegetable broth as a vegetarian/vegan alternative.</li>
            <li><strong>Water</strong>: Adjusts the consistency of the ramen soup.</li>
            <li><strong>Soy Sauce</strong>: Add a splash for savory flavor!</li>
            <li><strong>Baby Bokchoy</strong>: I love adding greens to ramen. These can be chopped or left whole. You can also use spinach!</li>
            <li><strong>Instant Ramen Noodles</strong>: You only want the uncooked noodles. Throw out those seasoning packets! You can also use fresh ramen noodles if you can find them.</li>
            <li><strong>Salt and Pepper</strong>: Add to taste.</li>
            <li><strong>Grilled Chicken</strong>: I added sliced grilled chicken but you can also use pork or chashu. For a vegetarian protein, try adding tofu!</li>
            <li><strong>Soft Boiled Egg<strong>: A must-add for ramen.</li>
            <li><strong>Sliced Green Onions</strong>: Add extra flavor to the broth.</li>
            <li><strong>Sesame Seeds</strong>: For garnish and nutty flavor.</li>
        </ul>
